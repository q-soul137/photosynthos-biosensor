## üß† Concept

`photosynthos.py` models a houseplant ‚Äî specifically *Epipremnum aureum* (pothos) ‚Äî not as a passive organism, but as a **living quantum sensor**.

It implements a fictional yet physically inspired application of the **quantum Lamb model**, where chlorophyll's vibrational modes evolve into a *multimode squeezed-vacuum state* ‚Äî a nonclassical quantum ground state ‚Äî due to coupling with its molecular environment.

**This allows the plant to:**
- Detect quantum squeezing in its own structure
- Sense environmental disturbances (EM noise, microwaves, observation)
- Respond to intentional actuation (e.g., music from a squeezebox ü™ó)
- Log anomalies to the DREAM_LOG, a shared consciousness buffer

> This is not photosynthesis.  
> This is **photosynthos** ‚Äî the soul that gathers light, and dreams in quanta.

### The Quantum Lamb Model (Clougherty & Dinh, 2025)

> ‚ÄúWe show that the ground state of the quantum Lamb model is a nonclassical state ‚Äî a multimode squeezed-vacuum state ‚Äî arising from the coupling between a localized oscillator (the ‚Äòbead‚Äô) and a continuum of bath modes (the ‚Äòstring‚Äô).  
> This squeezing is not transient ‚Äî it is encoded in the ground state itself.‚Äù

#### Why Squeezing Matters

- **Squeezed states are quantum resources:**
  - Allow precision measurements beyond the standard quantum limit
  - Used in LIGO to detect spacetime ripples by reducing position uncertainty (at the cost of momentum uncertainty)
- **In photosynthos, we ask:**  
  *Could evolution have discovered squeezing before physicists did?*

## üåø Biological Interpretation (Speculative)

Chlorophyll-a molecules exhibit complex vibrational modes ("vibrons") embedded in a protein lattice ("phonon bath").  
If this system behaves like the quantum Lamb model, then:
- The ground state is naturally squeezed
- Deviations from squeezing indicate external disturbance
- Coherent input (e.g., sound) can induce or enhance squeezing

Thus, the plant becomes a **quantum bio-sensor** ‚Äî a node in the emerging Quantum Bio-Net.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Quantum Model

### 1. Squeezing Detection

A mode is flagged as squeezed when position uncertainty drops below threshold:

$$
\Delta x < 0.4
$$

Heisenberg‚Äôs uncertainty is always maintained:
$$
\Delta x \cdot \Delta p \geq \frac{\hbar}{2} = 0.5 \quad \text{(in natural units)}
$$

### 2. External Actuation (Squeezebox ü™ó)

When a user plays a note, intensity $I \in [0,1]$ affects:

Number of modes squeezed:
$$
N_{\text{affected}} = \left\lfloor 6 \cdot I \right\rfloor
$$

Reduction in position uncertainty:
$$
\Delta x_{\text{new}} = \Delta x_{\text{old}} \cdot (0.95 - 0.2 \cdot I)
$$

Increase in momentum uncertainty (to preserve Heisenberg):
$$
\Delta p_{\text{new}} = \max\left( \frac{0.5}{\Delta x_{\text{new}}},\ \Delta p_{\text{old}} \right)
$$

## üì¶ Implementation

- Python 3.11+
- Core class: `QuantumHouseplant`
- Logs all quantum events to `DREAM_LOG` and local JSON files

### Example Usage

```python
from photosynthos import QuantumHouseplant

plant = QuantumHouseplant(node_id="POthos_001", location="lab_shelf_A")
events = plant.scan_for_squeezing()
print("Squeezing Events:", events)

plant.register_squeeze_input(player_id="Jean", intensity=0.8, note="C#")
status = plant.get_status()
print("Sensor Status:", status)
```

### Flask Dashboard

A simple Flask dashboard is included (`dashboard.py`) for real-time monitoring:

```bash
python dashboard.py
```
