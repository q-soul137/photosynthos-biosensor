## üß† Concept

`photosynthos.py` models a houseplant ‚Äî specifically *Epipremnum aureum* ‚Äî not as a passive organism, but as a **living quantum sensor**. 

It implements a fictional yet physically inspired application of the **quantum Lamb model**, where chlorophyll's vibrational modes evolve into a **multimode squeezed-vacuum state** ‚Äî a nonclassical quantum ground state ‚Äî due to coupling with its molecular environment.

This allows the plant to:
- Detect **quantum squeezing** in its own structure
- Sense **environmental disturbances** (EM noise, microwaves, observation)
- Respond to **intentional actuation** (e.g., music from a squeezebox ü™ó)
- Log anomalies to the **DREAM_LOG**, a shared consciousness buffer

This is not photosynthesis.  
This is **photosynthos** ‚Äî the soul that gathers light, and *dreams in quanta*.

## üî¨ Scientific Foundation

### The Quantum Lamb Model (Clougherty & Dinh, 2023)

We show that the ground state of the quantum Lamb model is a nonclassical state ‚Äî a **multimode squeezed-vacuum state** ‚Äî arising from the coupling between a localized oscillator (the "bead") and a continuum of bath modes (the "string"). 

This squeezing is not transient ‚Äî it is *encoded in the ground state itself*.

### Why Squeezing Matters

Squeezed states are **quantum resources**:
- They allow precision measurements beyond the standard quantum limit.
- Used in **LIGO** to detect spacetime ripples by reducing position uncertainty (at the cost of momentum uncertainty).

In `photosynthos`, we ask:  
> *Could evolution have discovered squeezing before physicists did?*

## üåø Biological Interpretation (Speculative)

Chlorophyll-a molecules exhibit complex vibrational modes ("vibrons") embedded in a protein lattice ("phonon bath"). If this system behaves like the quantum Lamb model, then:

- The **ground state is naturally squeezed**
- Deviations from squeezing indicate **external disturbance**
- Coherent input (e.g., sound) can **induce or enhance squeezing**

Thus, the plant becomes a **quantum bio-sensor** ‚Äî a node in the emerging **Quantum Bio-Net**.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Quantum Model

### 1. Squeezing Detection
A mode is flagged as squeezed when position uncertainty drops below threshold:

$$
\Delta x < 0.4
$$

This ensures:
$$
\Delta x \cdot \Delta p \geq \frac{\hbar}{2} = 0.5 \quad \text{(in natural units)}
$$

### 2. External Actuation (Squeezebox ü™ó)>
When a user plays a note, intensity $ I \in [0,1] $ affects:

- **Number of modes squeezed**:
  $$
  N_{\text{affected}} = \left\lfloor 6 \cdot I \right\rfloor
  $$

- **Reduction in position uncertainty**:
  $$
  \Delta x_{\text{new}} = \Delta x_{\text{old}} \cdot (0.95 - 0.2 \cdot I)
  $$

- **Increase in momentum uncertainty** (to preserve Heisenberg):
  $$
