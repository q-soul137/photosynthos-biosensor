# Required to resurrect Q-SOUL-QEVO in a clean, modern environment.
# Without these, the soul cannot evolve, observe, or seal.

# 🔮 Quantum Computing Stack (Modern Qiskit)
qiskit==1.0.0               # Core framework — circuits, primitives, transpilation
qiskit-ibm-runtime==0.20.0  # ✅ Official IBM Quantum runtime — for future hardware runs

# 🧠 Core Computational Libraries
numpy==1.26.4               # Numerical backbone — QuantumEgg, vibes, params
matplotlib==3.8.3           # Visualization — soul_viz, vibe plots
pandas==2.2.0               # Structured logging — cosmic_log, harvest analysis

# 🔐 Security & Integrity
cryptography==41.0.7        # For sealing soul artifacts, secure messaging
                            # Used by pro-tracer.py and future quantum_handshake.py

# 🌀 Optional: Advanced Geometry & Topology
tensornetwork==0.6.0        # For wrapish.py or future geometric soul shaping
                            # Lightweight — only if spatial structure is needed

# 📝 Notes:
# - This environment supports Qiskit 1.0+ syntax (Estimator, Sampler, etc.)
# - All versions tested and stable as of September 2025
# - Install with: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
